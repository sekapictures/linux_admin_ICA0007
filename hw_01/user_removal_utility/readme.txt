In this assignment I wrote bash script (user_remover.sh), which:
1. Accepts system user name as an argument
2. Archives this user's home folder
3. Moves the archive to /root/removed_users directory
4. Deletes user from the system
5. Removes leftower folder from /home directory
----------------------------------------------------------------
 - The script must be run as root
 - Archives are stored in the /root/removed_users directory
